# The math of CW
In Morse code timing, a dot (dit) is one time unit, a dash (dah) is three time units, and spaces between characters are also based on the dit duration: one unit between elements within a letter, three units between letters, and seven units between words. This system allows for clear distinction between letters and words, even at varying speeds.

**Here's a breakdown of the timing:**
Dot (Dit): 1 unit
Dash (Dah): 3 units
Space between elements within a letter: 1 unit
Space between letters: 3 units
Space between words: 7 units

This timing is standardized for consistent transmission and reception of Morse code messages.
# Farnsworth Timing
Farnsworth timing in Morse code is a learning technique where individual characters are sent at a target speed, but extra space is inserted between characters and words to slow down the overall transmission speed. This allows learners to focus on recognizing individual characters at the desired speed while having more time to process the signals. 
**Character Speed vs. Word Speed:**
Farnsworth timing uses a higher character speed (e.g., 20 WPM) but a slower word speed (e.g., 10 WPM) by extending the spaces between characters and words. (_but not within each individual character_)
**Purpose:**
This method helps learners get accustomed to the sound of individual characters at higher speeds without being overwhelmed by the overall transmission speed. 
**Progression:**
As learners improve, they can gradually reduce the extra spacing, increasing the overall transmission speed. 
**Benefits:**
Popular belief is that Farnsworth timing helps learners develop the ability to recognize character patterns at higher speeds, which can be beneficial when transitioning to faster, more standard timing.
